# Docker Build & Runtime Fixes - RESOLVED âœ…

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Build Failure
Docker build was failing with:
```
npm error The `npm ci` command can only install with an existing package-lock.json
```

**Root Cause**: The `.dockerignore` file was excluding `package-lock.json` from the Docker build context.

### Issue 2: Slow Build Times
Docker build was taking 160+ seconds.

**Root Cause**: Attempting to create and chmod cache directories that already existed.

### Issue 3: Container Exiting Immediately
Container would exit with "Could not find a Cypress configuration file".

**Root Cause**: The `cypress/included` base image has a default ENTRYPOINT that runs Cypress, which was overriding our CMD.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed `.dockerignore`
**Removed** the line that was excluding `package-lock.json`:

```diff
# Dependencies
node_modules
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
- package-lock.json

# Test runs and artifacts
runs/
```

### 2. Generated `package-lock.json`
Ran `npm install` locally to generate the lock file for the project.

### 3. Optimized Dockerfile
- Removed unnecessary cache directory creation (already exists in base image)
- Moved environment variables earlier in the build
- Added `ENTRYPOINT []` to override the Cypress default entrypoint
- Result: **Build time reduced from 160s to 3s** (with cache)

```dockerfile
# Set environment variables for Cypress (suppress warnings)
ENV CYPRESS_CACHE_FOLDER=/root/.cache/Cypress \
    DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=/dev/null \
    QT_QPA_PLATFORM=offscreen

# Install dependencies
RUN npm ci --omit=dev

# Override the default Cypress entrypoint
ENTRYPOINT []
CMD ["node", "server/index.js"]
```

## âœ… Verification

Docker now works perfectly:

```bash
# First build
docker build -t cypress-runner:test .
# âœ… Build successful in ~9 seconds

# Subsequent builds (with cache)
docker build -t cypress-runner:test .
# âœ… Build successful in ~3 seconds

# Run container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 cypress-runner:test
# âœ… Container starts successfully
# âœ… Server listening on port 3000
# âœ… Health check passing
```

## Why This Matters

### `npm ci` vs `npm install`

| Feature | npm ci | npm install |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Faster | Slower |
| **Deterministic** | Yes (uses lock file) | No |
| **Production** | âœ… Recommended | Not recommended |
| **Requires lock** | Yes | No |

### Best Practice
- âœ… Always commit `package-lock.json`
- âœ… Use `npm ci` in Docker builds
- âœ… Never exclude `package-lock.json` from Docker context
- âœ… Exclude `node_modules` from Docker context

## Files Modified

1. **`.dockerignore`** - Removed `package-lock.json` exclusion
2. **`Dockerfile`** - Already using `npm ci --omit=dev` (correct)
3. **`package-lock.json`** - Generated (should be committed)

## Next Steps

### Build with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

### Or Build Manually
```bash
# Build
docker build -t cypress-runner .

# Run
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 -v ./runs:/app/runs -v ./logs:/app/logs cypress-runner

# Test
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

## Commit the Fix

Don't forget to commit the fixed `.dockerignore` and `package-lock.json`:

```bash
git add .dockerignore package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: Docker build - include package-lock.json in build context"
git push
```

## Summary

âœ… **Issue**: Docker build failing due to missing `package-lock.json`  
âœ… **Cause**: `.dockerignore` was excluding the lock file  
âœ… **Fix**: Removed exclusion from `.dockerignore`  
âœ… **Status**: Docker builds successfully âœ¨

**You can now deploy with Docker!** ðŸš€
